# Feature-Selection-Techniques
## Dropping constant features
Removing the features which have constant features which are actually not important for solving the problem statement.
### Variance Threshold 
Feature selector that removes all low-variance features.This feature selection algorithm looks only at the features (X), not the desired outputs (y), and can thus be used for unsupervised learning.
## Correlation
Removing the features which are highly correlated and also used to check the corelation between Input features and Target output.
