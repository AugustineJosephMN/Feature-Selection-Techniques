# Feature-Selection-Techniques
Dropping constant features:Removing the features which have constant features which are actually not important
for solving the problem statement
Variance Threshold
Feature selector that removes all low-variance features.
This feature selection algorithm looks only at the features (X), not the desired outputs (y), and can thus be used for unsupervised learning
